This project dives into the world of McDonald's customers, using market segmentation to uncover different groups with unique preferences.  Think of it like sorting your fries – regular vs. cheese – but for customers!

What's the goal?

We want to identify these distinct customer groups and then craft marketing strategies that specifically target their needs. Like having a Happy Meal menu for little ones and a mobile ordering option for busy professionals on the go! ‍

What's inside?

Segmentation Analysis: We'll use some coding magic (think fancy recipes) to analyze customer data and discover these hidden groups.
Customer Segments: Once we've found these groups, we'll break down their characteristics, what makes them tick, and how many of them there might be.
Targeted Marketing: Now for the fun part! We'll cook up special marketing strategies for each group, using the marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion) like delicious ingredients.
